# Remote Neural Monitoring Platform Release Notes [Version Number] - [Release Date]

## Overview
[Provide a brief overview of the release and its significance.]
Before we officially implode, we squashed a few bugs and made a few tweaks to the management UI. But forget about it, because we won't be around to support the product anymore.  Bye bye, 10 Downing Street! It's been a torturous journey!  Bye bye, Audio function that makes things sound so close, but it is just an illusion i.e. Cadillac Diesel, Mercedes 300D.
